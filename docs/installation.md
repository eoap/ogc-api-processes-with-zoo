# Installing the ZOO-Project Helm chart on your platform

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed and set up on your local environment:

### Skaffold

Skaffold is used to build, push, and deploy your application to Kubernetes. 

You can install it by following the instructions [here](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/#standalone-binary).

### Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, enabling you to manage Kubernetes applications easily. 

You can install it by following the steps [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

### Docker.Desktop (required for Apple silicon)

You can install it by following the steps [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/).

From Docker.Desktop, enable Kubernetes in the Kubernetes settings pannel. Click on "Apply & restart" button.

### Minikube (not required for Apple silicon)

Minikube runs a local Kubernetes cluster, ideal for development and testing. 

You can install it by following the guide [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start).

Start your minikube instance with:

```
minikube start
```

### Optional requirements

#### Kubectl

Kubectl is a command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. It allows you to manage and inspect cluster resources. While not strictly required, it's highly recommended for debugging and interacting with your Kubernetes environment.

You can install it by following the instructions [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).

#### OpenLens

OpenLens is a graphical user interface for managing and monitoring Kubernetes clusters. It provides a visual way to interact with resources. 

While it's optional, it can significantly improve your workflow. You can download it [here](https://github.com/MuhammedKalkan/OpenLens?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

### Add the helm repositories


```
helm repo add localstack https://helm.localstack.cloud
helm repo add zoo-project https://zoo-project.github.io/charts/
```

### Checking the requirements

After installing these tools, ensure they are available in your terminal by running the following commands:

```bash
skaffold version
helm version
# The following command is not required to work on Apple silicon
minikube version
```

If all commands return a version, youâ€™re good to go!

## Deploying the workshop environment

For the purpose of this workshop, we will use the following GitHub repository: [dev-platform-eoap](https://github.com/eoap/dev-platform-eoap) from the EOAP organization.

Start the workshop environment.

````
git clone https://github.com/eoap/dev-platform-eoap.git
cd dev-platform-eoap/ogc-api-processes-with-zoo/
skaffold dev -p standard
# Apple user must use the additional options below
docker pull zooproject/zoo-project:dru-2b3610cbb1198accadc14b6dead93ae29bd927fd --platform linux/amd64
skaffold dev -p macos --platform linux/amd64 --enable-platform-node-affinity=true
````



After some time you will see something like the following indicating that everything is in place.
