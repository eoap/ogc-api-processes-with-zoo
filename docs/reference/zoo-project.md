# ZOO Project

The ZOO-Project is an open-source processing platform introduced in 2009, licensed under the MIT/X11 license. It facilitates integration and communication between existing software components using standards defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).

The platform aims to ensure that processing tasks follow the FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible.

The ZOO-Project supports the "**OGC API - Processes**" and implements the Web Processing Service (WPS) standards WPS 1.0.0 and WPS 2.0.0 edited by the OGC.
